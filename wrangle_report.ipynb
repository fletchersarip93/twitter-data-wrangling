    "# Quality Issues\n",
    "- Column Data Types - `twitter_df`\n",
    "    - `tweet_id` is of type integer, while it should be string because it's an ID.\n",
    "    - `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id` are of type float, while they should be string because they are IDs.\n",
    "    - `timestamp` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` are of type string, while they should be datetime.\n",
    "- Column Data Types - `image_pred_df`\n",
    "    - `tweet_id` is integer, while it should be string since it is an ID.\n",
    "- Data Quality - Dog Stage Columns \"None\" String Values\n",
    "    - There are string \"None\" values in `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, and `puppo` columns, which are invalid and misleading. This can make it hard for programmatic analysis later on.\n",
    "- Column Data Type - Dog Stages Columns in `twitter_df`\n",
    "    - For the `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, and `puppo` columns, I would expect their data types to be boolean instead of string, with value `True` if the corresponding dog stage appears in the tweet status.\n",
    "- Data Accuracy - Multiple Dog Stages in a Row (while actually there is only one dog)\n",
    "    - Some rows actually only have one dog, but the tweet status mentions multiple dog stages in the text. For these cases, the multiple dog stages will be misleading.\n",
    "- Data Accuracy - `rating_numerator` and `rating_denominator` in `twitter_df`\n",
    "    - It seems that the original rating detection didn't take into account possibility of the rating having decimal point in the numerator.\n",
    "    - Some of the denominator are not 10.\n",
    "- Data Validity - Dog Name in `tweet_dog_info_df` Containing Invalid Names\n",
    "    - Mostly the invalid names are the \"None\" and all the names that starts with lower case."

    "# Tidiness Issues\n",
    "- Data Tidiness - `tweet_infos_df` separated from `twitter_df`\n",
    "    - An obvious data tidiness issue is the `tweet_infos_df` being separated from the `twitter_df`. Both of them should be combined together, because the columns `retweet_count` and `favorite_count` should belong to `twitter_df`.\n",
    "- Data Tidiness - Change Index of `twitter_df` and `image_pred_df` to `tweet_id`\n",
    "- Data Tidiness - Dog State and Dog Name Columns should not be in `twitter_df`"
