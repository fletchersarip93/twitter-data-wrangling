Data wrangling and analysis of the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account. In this data analysis, I will analyze the dog ratings present in the tweet statuses. The tweet statuses are mainly obtained from the give tweet archive (given by Udacity). But information regarding retweet count and favorite count were obtained using Tweepy API.
